♥️♠️ FROM CASINO MATH TO WALL STREET: ♦️♣️
🎲 A GAMBLER'S GUIDE TO PORTFOLIO THEORY 💰
A Python package exploring the inevitably close connections between PORTFOLIO THEORY and GAMBLING STRATEGIES 🎲📊

Implemented classic work from Markowitz (1952), Kelly (1956), and Dubins & Savage's "How to Gamble If You Must" (1965). The math behind these papers is beautiful - turns out optimal gambling strategy when you're at a disadvantage (bold play: bet everything) is completely different from optimal investing when you have an edge (Kelly criterion: bet fractionally).

Created 4 Jupyter notebooks comparing:
• Mean-variance vs Kelly criterion - why maximizing geometric mean ≠ arithmetic mean
• Bold vs timid play in subfair games (spoiler: go big or go home when odds are against you)
• Different utility functions (log, power, exponential) and how risk aversion shapes portfolios
• Multi-period rebalancing with transaction costs and regime changes

The package shows how Kelly = log utility = mean-variance with λ≈2. Also explored when concentrated bets beat diversification (hint: when forced into negative expectation situations).

Really enjoyed connecting the theoretical foundations to practical simulations. The visualizations make it clear why fractional Kelly (25-50%) is so popular in practice - full Kelly can be quite aggressive! 🦍
